# Sleep_Splitter
A program that vizualises different sleep schedules and their amounts of sleep for you.

Birth: I tried a polyphasic sleep schedule giving 2 extra hours of productive wakefulness, and I wondered what other sleep schedules I might be able to adhere to and how many more productive time can be gained. I wanted to write a program that could split a day up into chuncks of sleep and non-sleep, according to the user's specification of how many hours they would like to sleep. 

Requirements:
 1. Visualization of a 24 hour day, and how different sleep schedules would look in that day
 2. Text boxes where the user can specify variables such as number of sleep hours/number of nap sessions
